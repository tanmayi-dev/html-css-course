## 1. Introduction

- Static Website

  - the files are sent as they are from the server to the client requesting data
  - these websites can be created using html, css and javascript

- Dynamic Website

  - This requires a backend
  - The content is changing all the time
  - The application runs on the server
  - and has a database which stores all the data being displayed
  - to do this, html, css and js are not enough
  - to write applications executed on webservers, we use php, node, python etc backend languages
  - these languages take data out of database and assemble this data into final files which will then be sent to a browser

  html = noun
  css = adjective
  js = verb

# 2. HTML Fundamentas

- HyperText Markup Language
- HTML is a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of webpage (not a programming language)
- HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content

- header tags range from h1 through h6
- strong tag : for bold letters
- em tag : italics
  <!--
   <h1>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML</h1>
      <h2>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML</h2>
      <h3>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML</h3>
      <h4>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML</h4>
      <h5>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML</h5>
      <h6>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML</h6>
      -->

      <!--
        Old HTML:
        <b></b> - bold: It is an element without specific meaning.
        It is an old HTML element.

        <i></i> - italic: It is a simple element with no semantic meaning.


        Semantic HTML:
        <strong></strong> - bold: This is semantic HTML element which means it has a meaning.
        It is given more importance.

        <em></em> - italic: This is used to emphasize (italicize).
        And browser understands that it has been emphasized.
